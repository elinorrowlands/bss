# Biodivergent Sites and Sounds

Project led by artist Elinor Rowlands in partnership with Canal and River Trust London South East, funded by Arts 
Council England. Other partners include Camden Creative Health and Cole's Gallery Leeds. 

The [main website](https://elinorrowlands.github.com/) is hosted on GitHub pages from this repository. We are using this to upload experiments and document the development process.

## Elements
The main site consists of six elements, each with a unique design and interactive feature based on the story of the canal.
**- [Index of elements](https://elinorrowlands.github.io/bss/elements) -**

The site should work on all devices, but for the best experience a touch screen is recommended.  

Google Chrome is recommended for desktop use.
